# Summary
 - Based off a popular digital billboard app, HootyHoo allows people to anonymously post voice recordings to a local geographic radius. Voice recordings can be sent with a note. 
 - We expect people to use this to be funny and social, or for advertising. An username system is considered to be implemented with optional anonymity. 
 - Other features include "auto-play" for on the go listening to "hoots", and a radio/podcast for individual users.
