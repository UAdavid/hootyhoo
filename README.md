# Summary
 - Based off a popular digital billboard app, HootyHoo allows people to anonymously post voice recordings to a local radius. Voice recordings can be sent with a note. 
 - We expect people to use this to be funny, sexy, or for advertising. An username system is considered to be implemented with optional anonymity. 
 - Other features include "auto-play" for on the go listening, a radio and podcast for specific users.
